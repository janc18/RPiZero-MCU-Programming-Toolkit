# RPiZero-MCU-Programming-Toolkit

This terminal will have:

* 5in 800x480px HDMI Screen

* 1.2V 25Ah Battery pack (10 x (AA cells of 2500 mAh 1.2v each))

* Tool set to do debugging protocols(JTAG,UART,SPI,i2c) and GPIO exposed

* Controlled output voltage with Kernel module

* USB hub with 4 ports

Under the hood it will have a SBC with a Linux distribution (probably Raspian), the best form factor in my opinion, for
this particular purpose it's the Raspberry Pi Zero.

Some good option are:

* MangoPi mq-quad

* Radxa Zero

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2

It's choose the next HDMI ports and cables
